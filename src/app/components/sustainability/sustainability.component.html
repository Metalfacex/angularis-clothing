            <h4>Cotton</h4>
            <p> 
                We source certified organic cotton, which is grown without the use of pesticides or synthetic fertilizers and requires less irrigation as it relies mainly on rainwater.
                
                (1). Avoiding harmful pesticides preserves soil biodiversity and protects the health of surrounding communities.
                
                (2). Our organic cotton fabrics are made using organic cotton yarns that are certified by the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS)</p>

            <h4>Wool</h4>
            <p> 
                Wool is a natural fiber with added performance attributes such as
                 temperature regulation, durability, and natural water repellency. 
                Considered a circular product by nature, wool can be recycled or
                 biodegraded easily. Animal welfare is extremely important to us, and 
                therefore we only source mulesing-free wool from producers that follow 
                humane and eco-friendly processes aligned with our animal welfare
                 guidelines.

            <h4>Linen</h4>
            <p>Found throughout our collections, linen is a sustainable fiber made from the flax plant. Flax is naturally pest resistant that requires less pesticides, water and energy to produce compared to cotton and polyester. Flax aids in sequestering carbon into the soil, which removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and is beneficial for improving soil health.</p>

The silkworms are fed mulberry tree leaves from organic agriculture that uses no pesticides or harmful chemicals and resulting in a lustrous fabric that is gentle on both you and environment. this responsibly sourced material epitomizes our dedication to creating exquisite clothing with a conscience. </p>

        <p>we are continually exploring more sustainable alternatives that offer the same quality and performance. we will soon add new fabrics in to our collections which are recycling and repurposing. By giving a new life to leftover fabrics through recycling and repurposing, we can reduce our demand on the planet’s limited natural resources. Recycled fabrics are made using the waste from both the pre- and post-consumer stage of a product’s life. </p>
